# このセクションについて

Now we have covered the basics of quantum computing, we are now ready to introduce some quantum protocols and algorithms. Through these algorithms we will see the concepts from the last chapter in action, and we will introduce new ideas and techniques. Some of the first algorithms you will learn about will be proof-of-concept algorithms that were developed to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computers. These algorithms are a great place to start; they showcase techniques that were later adapted into the ‘useful’ algorithms that caused excitement about quantum computing, and they will allow us to tackle core ideas in their simplest form. The proof-of-concept algorithms are also useful as a benchmark when testing hardware.
